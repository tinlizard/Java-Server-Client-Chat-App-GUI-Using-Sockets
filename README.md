# Java-Server-Client-Chat-App-GUI-Using-Sockets
A graphical user interface program made in Java that uses sockets to make a chat app. The app should work for the most part, however I was too lazy to implement a working scroll bar, so it kind of just is there and does nothing to really help. Also, this only works for one client at a time! Multiple clients will not work since I have not implemented Threads yet into the code.
